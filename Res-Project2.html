<h1>PROJECTS</h1>

<p>One of my more on going projects is the Pi Phone. With all of the 'hacks' that have<br>
come to light I would like to have more control over my data. The 'Smartphone' has been<br>
one of the weakest point of many of personal data breaches in the last 3 years. So why<br>
not do something about it? Sure I could just root my andriod  and have a google free<br>
phone thta would leaave me with less attack vectors, but would it have a RJ45 jack? No.<br>
GPIOs? NO. The ability to add extra wifi adapters and act as a man in the middle? No.<br>
There is so many things you could do with a raspi that you can't do with a regular samrtphone.<br>
All the Pi needs to beat any smartphone is to have the ability to make calls and send text<br>
which is not impossible with hats like the SIM7600 4G LTE moduale. After that just add a twitter, <br>
Facebook, and Instagram button to your home screen and you got a open source Smartphone<br>

<p>This device was made to put the finishing touches on one of my motor bikes before I<br>
sell it. A GPS speedometer is a easy find I could have just bought one off of ebay for<br>
$30 but what would be the fun in that? The first thing when coding for this is to get the<br>
GPS unit yelling NEMA outputs to you in the serial monitor after that its just copy and<br>
paste code from adafriut using the SSD1306 Oled library for your display. So things I<br>
learn form this project are that the antenna needs to be outside in a open space to pick<br>
up any satallites for information. Also, There is more than just speed Longitude and<br>
Lattitude for data. The unit also get Altitude, Satalite count, and time. When out putting<br>
all of that information your going to need a big display and that will be the next upgrade<br>
on this unit. Also There will be a split project sending this data through the LoRa network<br>
in the works. The code for this will be posted in the github repositories</p>

<p>I know you have qustions like can't you just buy something like this, or why does anyone<br>
need this. If you have a brick and mortor store it's a good piece of data to know how much<br>
foot traffic your getting. If you make any changes such as sells or specials your going to<br>
want to know if those changes made an impact. This is by far not the best to collect that<br>
data. Most likely a business owner would usually figure all that out by the number of sales<br>
because thats what counts. However what IF the business owner didn't want to share that<br>
information with a third party that need that data to know if their product was making an<br>
impact on sales. Well here you go.. Rig this up next to a door and start collecting the<br>
data.. I plan to take this project futher by having this information displayed on a wifi<br>
access point using a esp8266. The code for this will be posted in the github repositories</p>

<p> Ever wanted to take your website with you but even if you didn't have the internet<br>
available? Probaly not as most people assume that they will always have internet coverage and<br>
data no matter what. Ether way if your a weirdo and you still like the idea of being your own<br>
internet provider then this is the project for you. The esp8266 is well documented and has been<br>
around for over a decade and most people will never know this exsit. This is a very capable chip<br>
from espssiff and it's advanced version the esp32 can do even more. With the esp32 being able to<br>
do more also comes more attack vectors. The bluetooth BLE has already been compermised by hackers,<br>
so I'll stick with the venerable esp8266. The esp8266 is where I started to take off with web<br>
design as The webpages would have to be wrapped in C++ in order to work. Not only that but the<br>
esp8266 would only have 4MB of memory which means you can't load a super complex website with GIFs<br>
and large pictures. The big limiter would be that I could not use PHP as this was not a server<br>
with a OS. I found I could subtitute some of PHP's function with XML, Ajax, and JSON but it's just<br>
not the same. I found out just recently that if I needed to I could expand the memory of the<br>
esp8266 with a SD card attachment so I could have long file websites but that code I will not<br>
be posting. Instead I will post code for one of my older projects and I'll just let people do<br>
their own research as to how to get pictures on the website or how to load a website from SD<br>
card. The code for this project will be in the github repositories.<br>
