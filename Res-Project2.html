<p>This project was shevled for quite sometime. I had got into other things if you poke around my github you will only see a fraction of my projects that
  I've worked on this year. The explianation for this project is in the youtube description. Basically this project was about learning PHP but from there 
  came other projects that eventually had me crown javascript as the winner of the webpage since php can only be deploved on a server. Even for this github
  page I would love to make it more fuctional with PHP but this is not my server. </p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/tiy4YSU11Ws">Youtube Video</a>

<p>One of my more recent projects was to make a faceless non-offensive news reader. This project it to eventually be fully automated with web scraping
  feeding the host new information on a 24hr news cycle. The software used is FOSS pico2wave and it's not the worst I could get but what do you expect for
  free.. To see this in action I have provided the youtube link.  </p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHHT40uYpaZxPax9O6IYQBg">Youtube video</a>
